## 👋 Raed Massoud

I build software systems with a strong emphasis on **clarity, correctness, and long-term maintainability**.

Most of my work lives on the backend — designing APIs, modeling data, and reasoning about system behavior — but I’m comfortable moving across the stack when needed. I enjoy understanding *how pieces fit together*, not just making things work.

I’m especially interested in:
- Writing code that is easy to reason about
- Designing systems that fail safely
- Learning through building, testing, and breaking things

## 🧭 Current Focus

- Backend development with **Java & Spring**
- Full-stack workflows using **Angular**
- Security-oriented thinking (testing, invariants, edge cases)
- Exploring smart contracts, blockchain mechanics, and system trust
- Experimenting with AI / ML concepts out of curiosity, not hype
